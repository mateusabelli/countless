## Overview

Countless is a great solution for testing http requests on your front-end applications. This tool is designed to help diagnose and detect common problems such as request loops, simulate server responses with custom data payloads, and more!

Countless is not a mock API, it has similar tooling but a different purpose. You are going to enjoy using this tool to:

- Test your front-end request code to detect loops and misbehavior
- Simulate fake responses to test your front-end stability

## Quickstart

To get started access https://example.com and sign in to get access to your project dashboard.

Once you're logged in the platform, you are able to:

- Generate your unique endpoint for testing and development
- Manage your endpoint custom responses
- Reset or create new endpoints

## Self Hosting

Countless is a robust application that requires certain limitations in order to stay online for free usage. To use it at its full potential, you should consider self-hosting with Docker.
